# 📊 Marketing Campaign Effectiveness Report

## 📝 Overview

This is the final project of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at [Big Blue Data Academy](https://bigblue.academy/en). For this project we were in teams of 2 people, in this case, the project is made from [Anna Syrigonaki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-syrigonaki/) and [George Dimou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgedimou/). 

The project is about making an Annual Marketing Campaigns Effectiveness Report for a company that started operating in the US Market. The story around the company is fictional however, the data are from an actual dataset found in Kaggle. 

## 📂 Dataset 

The dataset used is the [Marketing Campaign Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishabhatt22/marketing-campaign-performance-dataset/data), which includes data for 4 companies, and out of them, we focused the analysis on the `Alpha_Innovations_Dataset.xlsx`. 

📌 ***Please keep in mind that, the dataset used in this analysis is fictional but representative of real-world marketing campaign data.***

## ⚙️ Prerequisites 

Before running the code, you need to set up the required environment. All necessary dependencies are listed in the `final_project_environment.yml` file provided in this repository.
To set up the environment:
Ensure [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) is installed on your system.
Use the `final_project_environment.yml` file (located in the root of this repository) to create and activate the environment.

## 🔄  Data Preparation 

In the analysis, we calculated the Median values since the values of the dataset followed mainly skewed distribution. We created extra columns for further analysis e.g. ROAS, CTR. 

The name used and the dataset are not related and are used only for fiction purposes.

## 🔬 Main Analysis

We decided to categorize and analyze the following:
- Audience Segmentation (Age and Gender groups)
- Performance of Audience Groups
- Advertising Performance for each Channel, 
- Performance for each Campaign Type
- Customer Segmentations
- Targeted Locations
- Revenue Performance

To conclude, we summarized the most important points and provided a few recommendations for future steps. 

The above-mentioned analysis was from the scope of Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and Click Through Rate (CTR). 


## 🛠️Tools 

The analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook, the graphics were made in PowerBI and the presentation through Canva. 

## 📈 Summary 

The presentation of this project was presented on the graduation day of the Bootcamp and here you can find the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYiF_UlXNPw&t=2s). Additionally, we created a website for the Advertising Agency that we were making this report for. Get a glimpse at the [Website](https://gdimou9.github.io/EdgeMedia.github.io/)!
